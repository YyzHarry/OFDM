# OFDM Simulation Project

## Introduction
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing~(OFDM) simulation project. It's a project of __Digital Signal Processing__ course, Peking University.

## System Model
This is the system model of OFDM. We use __Cyclic Prefix__, up/down-sampling and filter to simulate Multipath-fading Gaussian channel.

## Version
It has two versions, using __BPSK__ and __QPSK__ modulation, respectively. The FIR filter is designed for anti-aliasing when up/down sampling.
